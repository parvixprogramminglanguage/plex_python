**Native Blockchain Integration**: Built-in support for smart contract development with type-safe storage management, event systems, formal verification capabilities, and multi-chain deployment targeting various blockchain virtual machines.

**Actor-Based Concurrency**: First-class support for the actor model with location transparency, supervision hierarchies, fault tolerance mechanisms, and seamless scaling from local to distributed deployment scenarios.

**Advanced Type System**: Incorporates linear types for resource management, effect systems for computational effect tracking, dependent types for invariant expression, and comprehensive generic programming support with higher-kinded types.

**Cross-Reality Development**: Specialized features for building applications that span virtual worlds and physical reality, including universal digital identity systems, economic primitives, and real-time communication infrastructure.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install Plex using the official installer:

```bash
curl -sSf https://get.parvix.com/plex | sh
```

Alternatively, build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parvix/plex.git
cd plex
cargo build --release
```

### Hello World

Create your first Plex program:

```plex
// hello.px
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, cross-reality world!");
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
plexc hello.px
./hello
```

### Smart Contract Example

```plex
contract SimpleToken {
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    use std::contract::Storage;
    
    #[storage]
    struct TokenStorage {
        balances: Storage<HashMap<Address, u64>>,
        total_supply: Storage<u64>,
        owner: Storage<Address>,
    }
    
    #[event]
    struct Transfer {
        from: Address,
        to: Address,
        amount: u64,
    }
    
    #[constructor]
    pub fn new(initial_supply: u64) {
        let caller = self.caller();
        self.owner.set(caller);
        self.total_supply.set(initial_supply);
        self.balances.get_mut().insert(caller, initial_supply);
    }
    
    #[function]
    pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: Address, amount: u64) -> Result<(), String> {
        let caller = self.caller();
        let mut balances = self.balances.get_mut();
        
        let caller_balance = *balances.get(&caller).unwrap_or(&0);
        if caller_balance < amount {
            return Err("Insufficient balance".to_string());
        }
        
        *balances.entry(caller).or_insert(0) -= amount;
        *balances.entry(to).or_insert(0) += amount;
        
        self.emit(Transfer { from: caller, to, amount });
        Ok(())
    }
    
    #[view]
    pub fn balance_of(&self, account: Address) -> u64 {
        *self.balances.get().get(&account).unwrap_or(&0)
    }
}
```

### Actor System Example

```plex
actor BankAccount {
    var balance: u64 = 0;
    var owner: Address;
    
    pub fn new(initial_owner: Address) -> Self {
        BankAccount { 
            balance: 0, 
            owner: initial_owner 
        }
    }
    
    message Deposit(amount: u64) -> Result<u64, String> {
        self.balance += amount;
        Ok(self.balance)
    }
    
    message Withdraw(amount: u64) -> Result<u64, String> {
        if self.balance < amount {
            return Err("Insufficient funds".to_string());
        }
        self.balance -= amount;
        Ok(self.balance)
    }
    
    message GetBalance() -> u64 {
        self.balance
    }
}

fn main() async {
    let account = spawn BankAccount::new(Address::caller());
    
    let deposit_result = account.send(Deposit(100)).await;
    println!("Deposit result: {:?}", deposit_result);
    
    let balance = account.send(GetBalance()).await;
    println!("Current balance: {}", balance);
}
```

## Architecture Overview

Plex is built around several key architectural principles that distinguish it from traditional programming languages and make it uniquely suited for cross-reality development.

The **ownership system** provides memory safety guarantees without garbage collection overhead, using compile-time analysis to track resource lifetimes and prevent common programming errors. Linear types extend this system to provide additional safety guarantees for critical resources.

The **actor model** serves as the primary concurrency abstraction, providing location transparency and fault tolerance through supervision hierarchies. Actors communicate via typed message passing with protocol specifications that enable static analysis of communication patterns.

The **effect system** tracks computational effects at the type level, enabling precise reasoning about program behavior and supporting formal verification of critical properties. This is particularly valuable for blockchain applications where correctness is paramount.

**Blockchain integration** is achieved through native language constructs rather than external libraries, providing type-safe storage management, automatic gas optimization, and seamless deployment across multiple blockchain platforms.

## Development Environment

The Plex development experience is designed for productivity and reliability across the entire development lifecycle.

**Compiler**: Multi-stage compilation with comprehensive error reporting, advanced optimizations, and support for multiple deployment targets including native binaries, WebAssembly, and blockchain virtual machines.

**Language Server**: Full-featured language server providing intelligent code completion, real-time error checking, automated refactoring, and comprehensive project navigation for all major editors and IDEs.

**Build System**: Declarative project configuration with incremental compilation, parallel builds, dependency management, and integrated testing frameworks.
